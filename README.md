Phonepe Transaction and User Data Visualization Web App
Streamlit App

The Phonepe Transaction and User Data Visualization project is a Python-based solution that extracts data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository, transforms and stores it in a MySQL database, and displays it through an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, Plotly and few other visualization and data manipulation libraries. The solution includes multiple pages with various visualizations, allowing users to select different facts and figures to display. The project is efficient, secure, and user-friendly, providing valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse Github repository.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to have a few tools and libraries installed on your machine:

Python 3.7 or higher. [Note: Streamlit only supports .py files as of now. So, notebook(.ipynb) files are not recommended]
Git software.
MySQL software.
The pandas, streamlit, plotly, seaborn, altair, and mysql-connector-python packages.
Python
Python is the programming language used to develop this project. It is a popular high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, and machine learning. It provides a powerful and flexible foundation for working with data.

Git
Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in code. It is commonly used for collaborating on code and managing code changes. We used it here to clone the Pulse repository and extract the required data for analysis.

Pandas
Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. We used pandas to clean and preprocess the data, create new features, and perform data analysis. It provides a wide range of functions and methods for working with data.

MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. We used it here to store and manage the cleaned and processed data. It provides a scalable and secure solution for managing large amounts of data.

Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library used for building web applications. We used it here to create a multi-page application for visualizing the data. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing data.

Plotly
Plotly is a data visualization library used for creating interactive and dynamic plots. We used it here to create a variety of charts and visualizations, such as pie charts, bar charts, line plots, and choropleth maps. It provides a wide range of customization options and interactivity features.

Altair
Altair is a declarative data visualization library for Python. We used it here to create interactive visualizations using a grammar of graphics approach. It provides a simple and concise syntax for creating complex and dynamic visualizations.

Conducting market research: The app can be used to analyze transaction data to gain insights into consumer behavior and preferences, which can be valuable for conducting market research.

Developing predictive models: The insights gained from analyzing the transaction data can be used to develop predictive models, such as predicting future transaction volumes or identifying customers who are likely to churn.

Monitoring business performance: Data scientists can use the app to monitor the performance of various business metrics, such as transaction volume, revenue, and customer acquisition and retention.

Improving customer experience: By analyzing transaction data and identifying areas where customers are experiencing friction or challenges, data scientists can work with product teams to improve the customer experience and increase customer satisfaction.
